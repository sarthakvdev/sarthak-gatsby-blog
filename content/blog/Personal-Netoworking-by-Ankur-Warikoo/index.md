### **Introductory Points**:

---

- Networking is what make opportunities happen.
- Networking takes time. It is something you have to do consistently and over a period of time, you begin to reap the benefits of the network you have built and the tasks you have taken.
- Networking has nothing to do with you being either Introvert or Extrovert.
- Networking is no more about going to conferences or events showing up in a suit and handing out your stylish business cards. Time has changed, and so has networking.


### **Important Points to remember while networking:**

---

1. You *have* to reach out, You have to *write to the people you have to connect to*.
   You have no excuse to not to do that anymore. The World's brilliantly flat now.

   eg. Imagine if 10 years back you wanted to reach out Elon Musk. There was literally no way to reach him out. 

2. If you don't ask the answer is always no. And you will never ever fail if you don't ask.

3. Just check out who you are sending to and use proper Name of that particular person.

4. If you are disrespectful of the person's time from whom you want, **then you are never going to get it**.
   eg. If you send an attachment to ask feedback from someone.

    To get someone time, value their time. Dig deeper into what is it that that they can do for you. And be thoughtful around it.

5. You can not make a bond with someone just by saying "I want to network with you".
   The best way to strike a conversation is to form the connect by writing or saying the right things that form the connect.
   3 *Ways to form a connect are:*

    - **First Way:** Mostly everyone you want to reach out is either on Twitter, LinkedIn or Instagram, And The best things about these all 3 platforms are that there you can directly message the person. Engage with their content in a thoughtful manner, in a fashion that is mature, provocative, thought-provoking.
      The best thing about it is that if you are meaningful and have great content, they will respond.

    - **Second Way:** In case if they don't â†’ If you are meaningful, you are thoughtful, it is something that will stay in their mind and If you do that regularly, believe that they will just recognize you with just your name, And soon they will respond you. It's tremendously and miraculously powerful.

    - **Third Way:** *Go through someone who is a share connect.* This is how the world trully works, Its a Matrix of trust. Everything flows from trust.
